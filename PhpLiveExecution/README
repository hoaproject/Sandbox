Introduction
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
PHP live execution is an example of what is possible to do when combining a
Websocket server and PHP FastCGI to execute PHP in realtime. Outputs and
exceptions are indicated directly on the result panel, while errors are
indicated in the editor.


Usage
¯¯¯¯¯
We start the PHP FastCGI server:
    $ php-cgi -b 127.0.0.1:9000&

Then, we start the Websocket server:
    $ php Server.php

And all you have to do is to open the index.html page in on a browser and type
some PHP. Enjoy!
